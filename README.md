# MinesweeperExtension

This project is intended to do some experiments based on Minesweeper Solver by @DavidNHill (https://github.com/DavidNHill/Minesweeper)

# How to run

- `git submodule init`
- Configure project using your IDE. I suggest using Intellij IDEA.
- Run main functions

# Plans

- Make a human-like solver.
- Make a big testset (1M ~ 1B board on beg, int, exp)
- Find optimal play (in terms of winrate) for very common early game patterns
- Find optimal early game plays (in terms of win/3bv) for high difficulty boards
